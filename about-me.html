    <h2>Kieryn</h2>
    <p>My name is Kieryn, and I live in Southern California. I love reading and am working on learning Japanese. I love sushi, and, lucky for me, currently working at a sushi restaurant.</p>
    <p>I am working towards a Bachelors in Applied Technology, although I am currently not sure specifically what I want to do after. I love learning and I've really enjoyed all the programming I've done in the past. I'm excited to learn more in this class.</p>
